## Links

Google drive link = https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17Mb0GMBWarIL90cF60EfVq2hiQf-KCac?usp=drive_link

## Solution

1. A google drive link is provided with two folders named kdot and drizzy.
2. Both of them contain random files which are of the same context as the question but aren't useful for solving the question.
3. Except 1 file which is a pdf file(hope you get the joke ).
4. If you try to find the metadeta of the pdf file you will get a base64 encoding of a url
5. When decoded, the url is an imgur link which contains a childhood image of Mahatma Gandhi.
6. Image indicates that the QR is at Mahatma Gandhi Block.
