## Description of the Question

In the jungle’s heart, where dreams entwine,
A family of five embarks on a quest divine.
To the lush rainforest, their path they chart,
Each with their baggage, playing their part.

The mother carries eight units with grace,
Three daughters with four each, set their pace.
The father, strong, will handle the rest,
Ensuring their journey remains blessed.

Divide their loads with wisdom and care,
For in the baggage lies the answer there.
Link the pieces, let the mystery unfold,
To find the path to the Amazon’s hold.
