## Solution 
Step 1: User must follow the link.<br>
Step 2: User must ascertain the image in question ('The Last Supper' by Leonardo da Vinci). The artist's identity is implied by 'the genius polymath' and can be arrived at by Googling (google image search as well).<br>
Step 3: User must search specific to "harmonic melody" (or in relation to music) along with 'The Last Supper' based on the accumulated information.<br>
Step 4: User must read through the results to the search and arrive at Pala's work (refer: https://news.artnet.com/art-world-archives/last-supper-hidden-hymn-2432076)<br>
Step 5: User must relate the clue within the question to Pala's work.<br>
Step 6: User must figure out what one might count within music (might be measures, number of notes, the duration of the song).<br>
Step 7: Within the painting, notes are enclosed in the positioning of bread and the hands of figures present. The number of these notes (37) is the relevant answer.
