## Solution 

Standard galactic alphabet is the alphabet used by in Minecraft, specifically by the enchanting table to give names to the enchanted books created by it that grants the player a specific power.

On the Instagram posts on @acmvit, 7 of the CH posts have certain words in the standard galactic alphabet. They are in the following order:

-III Paper

-I Leather

-Book

-Lapis Lazuli

-Bane

-Of

-Arthropods

The first four words are ingredients to make the enchantment and the next three is the name of the enchantment itself. Bane of arthropods is an enchantment that keeps away all insect mobs in minecraft, giving the answer to the question. The player needs to input the string "bane of arthropods" to get the points deducing the answer by deciphering the words in the post that are written in standard galactic alphabet.
