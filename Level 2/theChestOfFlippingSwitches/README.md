## Description of the Question

On a bright, sunny day, three adventurous boys named Ralph, Jack, and Peterkin found themselves shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Amidst the lush greenery and vibrant coral reefs, they stumbled upon an ancient, weathered chest crested with Sixteen distinct jewels. With excitement, they pried it open, revealing a parchment filled with peculiar symbols and sequences reading:

o6t;Z2p>v386v9ywy"|>l8j>m:

Ralph, the thoughtful one, studied the parchment carefully. "This isn't a simple shift of letters," he mused. "It feels different, like it's hiding beneath the surface."

Jack, always the first to jump into action, suggested, "Maybe we should look for patterns or pairs. It's not about moving letters but transforming them in some way."

Peterkin, the youngest but sharp-witted, pointed out, "These symbols remind me of a riddle I once heard. It involved keys, but not the kind that turn locks. More like hidden switches that flip things around."

To solve the mystery, return to the start,
Where their journey began, let clues impart.
A hidden message you must unveil,
With a key to the secret, your quest prevails.

## Solution

1. The players must figure out that the boys Ralph, Jack and Peterkin are characters of the book " The Coral Island".
2. Peterkin mentions "hidden switches flipping things around" indicating at a XOR encryption.
3. The poetry instructs the players to go back to the start, where their journey began. The players must figure out that 1857, the year of publication of the book is the key to the encryption.
4. The chest has been mentioned to be crested with 16 jewels, indicating that the key is actually in hexadecimal.
5. On using XOR decryption with 1857 as a hexadecimal key, the message says "wallbehind anna auditorium", instructing the players to go to Anna auditorium and check its backside, the wall in front of GDN to scan the qr.
