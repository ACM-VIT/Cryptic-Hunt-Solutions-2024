## To solve the question 

    Solution: DEEPFRITZ

## Description of the Question

In the ancient realm of Albion, Queen Selene's legacy was ended by the ambitious Duke Ariston, who seized the throne. Despite achieving his goal, Ariston’s blundered governance led to turmoil and his eventual overthrow by the brave General Lysander. The kingdom’s people remembered the chaos and Ariston’s mistakes more vividly than the end of Selene’s reign, forever associating his rule with disarray rather than victory. Yet, kingdoms like Albion no longer exist in the modern world.

## Solution 

1. The player receives a link containing metadata that can be decoded using [this steganography tool](https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/).
2. The metadata is a link to [https://creepyhunt.neocities.org/mummy](https://creepyhunt.neocities.org/mummy), which contains hidden text: `aHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2ZpbGUvZC8xTk1jdGNhekloYzJmaUJVS3RGeFpicnFVak5YSXd5NzIvdmlldz91c3A9c2hhcmluZw==`.
3. This is a Base64 encoded string. When decoded, it provides a drive link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMctcazIhc2fiBUKtFxZbrqUjNXIwy72/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMctcazIhc2fiBUKtFxZbrqUjNXIwy72/view?usp=sharing).
4. The link contains a text file with encoded ASCII values representing chess moves from a game in the 2000 Chess Championship Finals between Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik.
5. The narrative in the paragraph relates to the match and provides a hint: Vladimir Kramnik ended Garry Kasparov's legacy and was declared champion. However, in 2006, Kramnik made a massive blunder in the chess championship and is now more famously remembered for that mistake rather than for ending Kasparov's legacy.
6. The answer is the string "DEEPFRITZ".
