## Description of the Question

In a covert operation involving top secret agencies like the Global Intelligence Bureau (GIB), the Shadow Operatives Network (SON), and the International Counterterrorism Unit (ICU), an urgent message has emerged. Theyâ€™ve intercepted an image that is more than what it seems. The image is believed to hold the path to a critical location which has the secrets needed to prevent an impending global disaster.

Despite their abilities, many agents from these agencies have tried to decode the image and locate the path, but all have failed. Once uncovered, this hidden path will lead to the location that must be reached to prevent a global catastrophe.

The image is designed as a puzzle, guiding you through a series of clues to uncover the path that is the key to saving countless lives. Your mission is to decode the image, trace the path and reach the location that has the secrets to ensure global safety.

## Solution

1. Players will be initially provided with an image and a password protected pdf file.
2. The image will have a combination of 2 ciphers 'bill cipher' and 'journal3 cipher' from gravity falls. Most of the players will immediately start solving the cipher but they don't have to do that yet.
3. Before solving the cipher, the player has to do the steganography analysis of the image. The player has to see the image name to figure out the website (mobilefish.com) for doing the steganography analysis. From the anaysis they will get a string 'brainerbigbraintime' which will be the password of the pdf file.
4. There will be four images in the pdf along with a clock showing the time as 9 o'clock. The first two images will give the clue of the initial cipher names - bill cipher and journal3 cipher. The clock time will give a pattern to decode the cipher. Since the clock is showing 9 o'clock, the first 9 symbols are of bill cipher, next 9 are of journal3 cipher and so on.
5. On solving the cipher they will get another ciphered string 'ivhol gqkqnzavxibkgjevtgxcjy evixvo zkk' which is a combination of vignere and altbash cipher. The last two images (book written by inventor of vignere cipher and mirror as altbash cipher is also know as mirror code) will give the clue of the cipher names. The key for the vignere cipher will be hidden in the pdf metadata. The key will be 'bcoztechmatters'. Again the first 9 symbols will be of vignere cipher, next 9 will be of altbash cipher and so on.
6. On solving the cipher, the player will get a string 'https codemazecryptichuntacm vercel app'. The player has to use it as a URL which will open a website.
7. The website will have a paragraph and random numbers around the paragraph to confuse the player. On inspecting the website and then going to sources tab to view the CSS file of the website, the player will see a comment out hint which will say 'Four numbers you need to reveal, Put them together, and a website will be real.'
8. After reading this most of the players will think that the four numbers are from the numbers displayed along with the paragraph. But since the comment is in the CSS file, which will have only four numerical values used for styling, those four numbers would be the one which they have to look at. The numbers will be 164, 100, 117 and 124.
9. On joining the numbers in order the player will get the value '164 100 117 124'. These four numbers will be the IP address of a website.
10. On changing these to an IP format by adding '.' they will get '164.100.117.124'. The players have to put this in the URL field of any brower which will open the website of National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization.
11. The player has to go to the 'Human Organ Manufacturing' building to get the QR code.
