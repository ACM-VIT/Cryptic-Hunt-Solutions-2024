## Description of the Question

Twenty-year-old Herbert has just discovered two links on his great-grandfather's Nokia phone. He seems to be stuck and needs help figuring out the steps to unravel the underlying algorithm.
Do not forget to remove the primes.

## Solution 

1. 2 links will be provided. 
2. The first link leads to a password encrypted PDF file.
3. The second link leads to a YouTube video which would end up with the player finding out the password they need to enter to access the contents of the PDF file, "say my name"
4. After opening the PDF file, the players will get a Google Drive link with six images which have information hidden in the metadata that reveals the plane one dimensional structure of a scrambled Rubik's cube.
5. The player has to use an online Rubik's cube solving tool to figure out the solution of the Rubik's cube in exactly 20 steps and then upload the steps needed to solve it in sequential order in one line after removing the prime symbols(') by substituting them accordingly (for eg. U' becomes UUU) which needs to be entered in the app.
