## Solution

Step 1: Obtain the Image <br>

- Receive the encoded image file and the entry point instructions.

Step 2: Extract the RGB Values

- Open the Image:
  - Use an image editing software like GIMP, Photoshop, or an online tool to open the encoded image file.
  - Extract RGB Values: Analyze the RGB values of each pixel in the image. This can be done using the softwareâ€™s color picker tool or by using a script to extract the values.

Step 3: Decode the Binary Message

- Identify the Least Significant Bits:
  - For each pixel, look at the red channel value.
  - Extract the least significant bit (LSB) from the red channel of each pixel.
- Form the Binary Sequence:
  - Combine the LSBs in the order they appear to form a long binary sequence.
- Group into Bytes:
  - Group the binary sequence into 8-bit segments (each segment representing a character in binary).
- Convert Binary to Text:
  - Convert each 8-bit binary segment to its corresponding ASCII character using a binary-to-text converter or an ASCII table.

Step 4: Follow the Decoded Message

- Read the Message:
  - The decoded binary message will spell out "KING ROAD SIGN CDMM PARKING".

Proceed to CDMM Parking and scan the QR code.
