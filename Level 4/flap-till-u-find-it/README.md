## Solution 

The players are presented with a drive link upon opening the question. The drive link contains a executable file of a flappy bird game. The players can install the zip file and open the game by clicking on the executable.

The game looks like a simple flappy bird game at first. The pillars which spawn in the game have a fixed pattern. The trick is that the pillars which spawn with a gap in the lower area is considered a dot. Upper area is a dash and a middle area gap is a whitespace. So after playing the game and noting down all the positions of the pillars, the players will be able to copy paste the morse code into a website and get the answer. The final string to be entered into the app is Pintu.
