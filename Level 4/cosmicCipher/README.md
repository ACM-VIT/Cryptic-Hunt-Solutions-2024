## To solve the question 
<br>
    Solution : "GENESIS" <br>
    players enter the string and get points <br>
<br>

## Description of the Question

In the core's quiet dusk, a heavy secret begins to weigh. The ancient fire sighs its last, as the night prepares to stay. What once burned bright now fades to grey, leaving only echoes of the day.
All because of -

## Solution 

The given hint is about the formation of iron in a star's core which leads to a star dying, A string is given which is an encoded version of electronic configuration of iron where orbitals are represented by numbers ie.
s = 1
p = 2
d = 3
f = 4
and numbers are represented by Alphabets
so they will have to understand how the encryption works and use that to decode the string given, first they need to break it up every time 1s orbital comes so everywhere there is A1, they will get
A1BB1BB2FC1BC2FD1BC3JD2B
A1BB1BB2F
A1BB1BB2FC1BC2B
A1BB1BB2FC1BC2D
on decryptic that they will get the electronic configration of Germanium(Ge) Neon(Ne)  Silicon(Si) and sulphur(S)
so the answer is the combination of them "GENESIS"
