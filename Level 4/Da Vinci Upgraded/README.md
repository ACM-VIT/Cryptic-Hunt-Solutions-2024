## To solve the question

qr Ending:
Location of QR : Main entrance corridor of Mahatma Gandhi Block
players get points directly

## Description of the Question

I am the greatest painter of all time, every conceivable piece of art that can ever exist I have already made. My prowess is so great that I have even created every inconceivable rendition as well. Don't believe me? check out a piece of my collection.

## Solution

The concept of this question revolves around the babel image library, similar to the library of babel that contains an infinite permutation and combinations of letter, the image library contains an infinite number of images with each pixel having a randomly generated colour, that theoretically contains all images("paintings") ever made.

The player first enters the art_piece pdf file, It contains a whole monologue with a lot of red herrings, vague non important hints and whole lot of gibberish. One of the more important hints is about colour and how the human eye cannot see all the colours that exists, and asking the player to "change their eyes" to see something new, analagoues to changing perspective and selecting the text of converting the pdf file to .txt to see the gif link hidden in white colour/ whitespace. Once the player finds and clicks this link the advance to the next sequence.

The player enters imgr and sees the collection consortium gif that is at extremely high speeds. The gif is made of 8 frames containing a message and a link. The message is "I preserve my collection using numbers want to see?" followed by another pdf link- location.pdf. the player is meant to splice the gif to its individual frames, the software i used to do this is: https://ezgif.com/split. The lonk leads them to the next sequence.

The location pdf contains a 313 page list of millions of numbers. The babel image library stores its images by attributing the pixels with these number values. The player is meant to copy ALL these values either directly from the pdf ot by converting it into word or .txt and then head to the babel image library website: https://babelia.libraryofbabel.info. This leads to them the next sequence/half sequence.

In the image archive website, the player cannot directly search the image using the location numbers. They MUST search a sample image, easiest would be to use one of the gif frame images using the search image tool in the website. Once they have done this they can use the babelia # under the image searched and enter the location numbers there and press the seek button to get final image. The image is the of the MGB block containing the design school. This gives them a physical location to find the QR from where they can Scan it and get the points.
