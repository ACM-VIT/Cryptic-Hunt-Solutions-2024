## To solve the question    

        Solution for 2nd part : licensetokill

## Description of the Question

Great work, Bond.

Now, the final task is to decrypt the code. The only information we have is your ex-partner's public key:

(n, e) = (4351450235177456633, 65537)

Additionally, we have discovered this drive link. Investigate it and extract the code to complete your mission.
