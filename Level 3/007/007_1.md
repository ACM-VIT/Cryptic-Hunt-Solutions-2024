## Description of the Question

Agent Bond,

Your mission is of utmost importance: a vital code, meant for you, was intercepted and is now in the hands of a mafia kingpin. This criminal mastermind has challenged you to a high-stakes poker game. Victory secures the code; failure... well, you understand the consequences.

Luck is somewhat on our side—the dealer is an ally. The hole cards are set, but the flop, the turn, and the river remain hidden.

Win at all costs. The mission depends on it.
