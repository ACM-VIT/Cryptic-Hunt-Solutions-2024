## Description of the Question

As Mozart's health rapidly declined, he feverishly worked on his Requiem, convinced it was for his own funeral. Bedridden and delirious, he scribbled notes on parchment, his quill trembling in his weakened hand. Between fits of coughing, he whispered to his wife Constanze about a hidden message in the score—a secret that could have saved him, if only he had the strength to reveal it. The answer, he murmured, lay within the very notes themselves, waiting to be deciphered by those who truly understood his music.

## Solution

- When the players open the link they see that its a pdf with sheet music
- The players must figure out that each note upto G represents the corresponding letter
- and after G, it rotates back, such as A=A....G,A=H,B=I and so on
- Going up one octave for each rotation
- Once they decipher it they get the location for the QR which is AL Mudaliyar block aka Chettinad Health Centre
