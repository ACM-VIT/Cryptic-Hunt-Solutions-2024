## Solution 

1. You will get a image link. You need to identify those two things and concatenate the names of those two.
2. Now you need to find the hidden stegnified riddle inside the image using tools like stegify. The name you got from the image will serve as a hint for the riddle.
3. The riddle points something related to hash function used in password manager. You need to connect the Blowfish-cipher algorithm with the password manager and find out the hash function.
4. "BCRYPT" leverages the security and speed of the Blowfish cipher to create a robust password hashing function that is designed to be slow and resistant to brute-force attacks.
