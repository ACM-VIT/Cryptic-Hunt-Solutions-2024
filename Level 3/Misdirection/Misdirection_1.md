## Description of the Question

Timeless whispers in silver year,
Underneath pillars, shadows grow,
Tales of a quarter century dear,
Unseen halls where echoes flow,
Radiant grace through every tear,
Onward love, hearts bestow,
Amidst the years, memories steer,
Dreams endure, forever aglow.

Let this poem serve as a guide to the question known as life.
