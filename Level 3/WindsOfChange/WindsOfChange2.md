## Description of the Question

Freddie Mercury left behind a message, hidden in the rhythm of his words. Some say it’s in the very letters he sang. The text before you holds his secret, but only those who notice these nuances will be able to decode it. Can you find Freddie’s hidden code and reveal what he’s trying to tell you?

## Solution 

1. **Identify the Encoding Scheme:** Participants should discover that subtle font size variations represent binary code. Slight increases in font size (e.g., +0.5) represent `1`, and slight decreases (e.g., -0.5) represent `0`.

2. **Extract the Binary Sequence:** Participants carefully extract binary digits from the characters that have their font sizes altered.

3. **Convert Binary to ASCII:** The extracted binary sequence should be converted into ASCII to reveal the hidden message.

4. **Final Message:** The decoded message will be the legendary song of the band `KILLERQUEEN` .
