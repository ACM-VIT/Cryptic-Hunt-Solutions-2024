## Solution 

1. **Identify the Morse Code:**  
   Participants need to realize that there’s a low-volume Morse code signal hidden within the song "Love of My Life" by Queen at the 1:20 mark.

2. **Extract the Morse Code:**  
   By isolating the faint audio pattern, participants should be able to identify the Morse code embedded in the song.

3. **Decode the Morse Code:**  
   Once they’ve extracted the Morse code, participants will need to decode it to reveal the message: `"ANYWHERE THE WIND BLOWS"`.
