## Solution 

1. The website is full of ASCII values which when converted to text reveals lowercase Base32 string. This has to be converted to uppercase which then can be decoded using Base32. 
2. The decoded Base32 string reveals Hexadecimal values.
3. The Hexadecimal has to then be converted to text which reveals a reversed Base64 string which when decoded reveals the link to another webpage: https://assets.cryptichunt.in/hunt/almost-there, this also reveals the answer for Sequence 2.
