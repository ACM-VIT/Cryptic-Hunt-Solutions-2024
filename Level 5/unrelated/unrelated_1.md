## To solve the question 

Solution:   

        KC

## Description of the Question

In the enchanted forest where Fibonacci’s sequence meets the tales of Wonderland, follow the Fibonacci trail through the first thirteen steps and decode the hidden pair. Seek the numerical pattern in Carroll’s world, shift them through an ancient key, one that is not slow and steady. Seek the option that does not include the elusive letter of the alphabet. Finally, use a Hellenic grid to lock in the coordinates "fourfour onefour" and reveal the secret duo that does not have to be examined.

## Hints

**Hint 1:** 
      
        Points: 50
        Index numbers, first letter of the words

## Solution 

1. Players are given a riddle using which they can deduce the elements involved in the question, Fibonacci, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The riddle hints to "the first thirteen steps" which means the first thirteen Fibonacci numbers, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144. The player has to then read through the first few paragraphs of the book and based on the Fibonacci numbers, the first letter from each word of the corresponding Fibonacci positions must be extracted (based on index numbers).

2. Upon extraction, a string is revealed

        AWWBTVSTOBOBB

3. Based on the riddle, the string has to then be encoded using a cipher that uses a key, a Vigenère cipher. The key can be obtained from the riddle as well as the name of the first chapter of the book, "RABBIT". Upon encoding, another string is obtained:

        RWXCBOJTPCWUS

4. This string has to be decoded using a "Hellenic grid" which refers to the Polybius square, the coordinates of which are given in the riddle. Upon being decoded, the string "KC" is revealed. Some might run to either KC Foods or KC Ground in search of a qr, but there is none (for this question). The string "KC" has to simply be entered in the app to gain points for the first part of the question.
