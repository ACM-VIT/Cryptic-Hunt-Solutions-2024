## Solution 

1. Audio File Processing
Players will first access an encrypted MP3 file provided through a Google Drive link. To uncover the hidden content, they need to utilize audio processing software like Audacity or FL Studio. When they play the audio file, they should pay attention to the timestamp of 2 minutes and 20 seconds, where an overlapping audio track is embedded. By adjusting the audio settings—specifically increasing the volume of lower frequencies while decreasing the volume of higher frequencies—they will be able to hear the concealed audio clearly. Using headphones or quality speakers is crucial for this task, as it enhances the listening experience. After successfully processing the audio, players will discover a specific timestamp: **4 hours, 29 minutes, and 42 seconds**.

2. YouTube Video
Next, players will utilize the second Google Drive link to access a YouTube video. After opening the video, they must navigate to the previously noted timestamp of **4 hours, 29 minutes, and 42 seconds**. It’s important to enable subtitles for the video, as this will allow players to read the text displayed on the screen. At this precise moment in the video, the subtitles will reveal a crucial password needed for the next phase of the challenge: the typing test. This connection between the audio and video adds an intriguing layer to the puzzle.

3. Executable File
Players will then turn their attention to the third Google Drive link, which contains a downloadable executable file. This file is integral to the next step of the challenge, as it hosts the typing test that players must complete. Upon launching the executable, players will be presented with a menu that guides them on how to start the test. This part of the challenge is designed to engage players further, requiring them to use the password obtained from the YouTube video to proceed.

4. Typing Test Instructions
To initiate the typing test, players must input the subcommand “type-test” as indicated in the menu of the executable file. Once the typing test begins, players will find themselves interacting with a text-based interface, where they will be required to type out various prompts. However, as they engage with the test, they will notice that certain letters do not highlight in green, signaling that these letters are part of a hidden clue. This unique observation is essential for unraveling the final part of the challenge, encouraging players to stay attentive while typing.

5. Identifying Key Letters
While participating in the typing test, players should carefully track the letters that do not highlight in green. These unhighlighted letters form a significant clue, and players need to collect them as they type. As they piece together these letters, they will ultimately spell out the word **"ragequit."** This process of collecting the hidden letters not only requires focus but also enhances the interactive experience of the typing test, making players feel like detectives uncovering a secret message.

6. Final Submission
Once players have successfully identified the word "ragequit," they should return to the main menu screen of the executable file. The menu will contain a prompt that subtly hints at where to enter the subcommand. By inputting “ragequit,” players will unlock the next stage of the challenge or receive the answer they have been working towards. The final answer is "CLI TOOLS ARE REALLY COOL".
