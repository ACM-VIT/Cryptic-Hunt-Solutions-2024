## Description of the Question

The bard sings, "Hidden secrets in our world, test in the terminals of darkness, more commands to seek". The hero replies, "We all play a role in this world, for the creator this is but a game, many forms, many shapes but the order is only one...survive". The bard keeps singing, "So says the hero but we are just actors on the scene, roleplay, acting...for a mere bard, that is the command. To play the role of the storyteller. But for the hero, the role is to be a saviour, a survivor indeed".

## Solution 

1. Game Access
Players will receive a Google Drive link leading them to the same command-line interface (CLI) game they encountered in the previous part. Within this game, a description will provide a hint that directs them toward the word **"Roleplay."** This word is pivotal for advancing in the game, and players must pay attention to the clues in the description to ensure they understand its significance. Once they have deduced the correct term, they can input **"Roleplay"** into the menu of the CLI game. Upon doing so, they will be greeted with a congratulatory screen that acknowledges their successful input, reinforcing their progress in the challenge.

2. Transition to the RPG Survival Guide
After entering the word "Roleplay," players will see instructions indicating that they should press **Enter**. Doing so will redirect them to another Google Drive link that contains a book titled "RPG Survival Guide." This book is essential for the next phase of the challenge and will present players with a variety of questions and answers that they will need to analyze carefully. The transition from the game to the book allows for a seamless continuation of the adventure, as players are rewarded with new content that builds on their previous engagement.

3. Navigating the Book
The RPG Survival Guide consists of **16 pages**, with **10 pages** dedicated to a series of questions and answers. However, the questions will be presented in a faded text format, making them less noticeable. Players will need to closely examine each of these pages to locate the answers, which have been altered from their original forms. This requires careful reading and critical thinking, as players must deduce the correct answers based on the information provided. Each answer they find will correspond to a unique combination of **2 numbers**, resulting in a total of **10 pairs of numbers** that players will need to collect.

4. Crossword Challenge
At the end of the book, there is a crossword puzzle that serves as the next challenge. Players will need to utilize the pairs of numbers they gathered from the questions to reference the grid of letters in the crossword. It is important to note that the indexing for the crossword begins at **0**, which means players must carefully apply their number pairs as indices to locate specific letters within the grid. This aspect of the challenge combines elements of logic and pattern recognition, adding depth to the gameplay experience.

6. Forming the Final String
As players navigate through the crossword puzzle, they will extract letters corresponding to the indices derived from their earlier answers. By combining all the letters collected through this process, players will ultimately arrive at the string **"MADEINRUST."** This string serves as the culmination of their efforts, representing the knowledge and skills they have acquired throughout the challenge. The playersâ€™ ability to piece together this string reflects their engagement and critical thinking throughout the entire sequence.

7. Entering the Result
Finally, players will need to input the string **"MADEINRUST"** into the app to receive points for their successful completion of this segment. This step ties everything together, rewarding players for their persistence and problem-solving abilities. By entering the final string, they not only signify the completion of the current challenge but also enhance their overall score, motivating them to continue exploring and engaging with the game.
