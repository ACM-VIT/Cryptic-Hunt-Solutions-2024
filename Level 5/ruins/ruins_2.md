## Description of the Question

In a kingdom of order, the subjects stood tall,
Each had their role, no repeats at all.
Harmony reigned, with balance in sight,
Where every step taken brought clarity and light.

But a whirlpool struck, twisting the land,
Now all’s in a spiral, spun out of hand.
Chaos reigns, no pattern at all,
To restore the order, you must answer the call.

B A 3 2 X 9 6 8 5 4 7 0 A 1 9 7 B X 3 6 4 8 5 B 9 A 7 2 0 8 1 6 X 3 A 7 8 2 5 0 4 6 9 1 5 X 7 3 B 0 4 2 6 9 3 X 2 8 4 5 A 6 1 2 7 B 3 X 4 5 9 0 X 3 9 7 2 B 1 6 4 X 2 7 A 5 B 8 A 1 5 0 7 B 3 0 9 1 5 A B 2 0 B 1 X A 5 3 B 8 7 2 4 6 3 8 1 9 1 5 2 X 4 A 6 9 8 X 3 9 0 A 3 X 8 4 0 9 6 1 4 B A

## Solution

The description hints towards it being a sudoku but there are 144 numbers ie its a 12x12 sudoku, the desciotion also hints towards it being in a spiral so when the player will plot the given number in a spiral pattern they will get this,

B A 3 2 X 9 6 8 5 4 7 0
1 5 X 7 3 B 0 4 2 6 9 A
9 6 4 X 2 7 A 5 B 8 3 1
6 1 5 3 B 8 7 2 4 A X 9
4 B A 8 X 3 9 0 6 1 2 7
0 2 X 9 6 1 4 A 3 5 8 B
5 7 1 6 9 A B 3 8 0 4 X
2 9 B A 0 4 8 X 1 7 5 3
8 3 0 4 X 2 5 1 9 B A 6
7 X 2 B A 5 1 9 0 3 6 4
A 0 9 5 4 X 3 B 7 2 1 8
3 X 6 1 8 0 2 7 A 9 B 5

they will fill up number in place of X to solve the sudoku and they will get the following digits 1 8 0 0 5 7 2 6 7 8 6 4 from top to bottom, on calling ( hinted in the descption) they will find out its samsung helpine number, so they will go to samsung store to scan the QR code.
