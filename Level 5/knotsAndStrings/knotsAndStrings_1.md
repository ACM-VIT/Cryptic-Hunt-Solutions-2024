## Solution 

1. The image talks about Arthur, a canon, a dial and a sign saying four. This is a reference to Arthur Conan Doyle's book "A sign of Four".
2. Opening the image in notepad gives you a peculiar pattern of stars and dashes resembling knots tied on a string similar to the ones being talked about in the story of Ealdred. 
3. These patterns are actually pages and word numbers in the book. 
4. Going to the page 8 and reading words 4,5,6 give us "Francois le Villard" the answer.
