## Description of the Question

1.  Where you are present at the moment is the hint to the next part of this question. (you are currently at gdn)

In a row where letters hold their place,
Multiply their position by ten to trace.
Seek the number that hides in the mix,
A simple trick to solve this fix.
Letters line up in a familiar row,
Decode their position to find what you know.
A ten times hint will bring it to light,
Unveil the number hidden from sight.

2.  Cr3+ (violet/green) → CrO42- (yellow)
    Fe3+ (yellow) → FeO42- (purple)

In these equations, the loss of electrons will colour your way to the right path where the key you seek lies. Discover the hidden secrets of the metals and decipher your way through the change in formats.
