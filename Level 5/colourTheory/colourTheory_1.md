## Solution

1. The user will be provided with an audio clip and a number pattern.
2. The audio clip will contain Morse code, which the user must carefully listen to and translate into text.
3. After deciphering the Morse code, the user will obtain the string: "Green Emerald Orange."
4. The number pattern provided will indicate specific positions of letters that the player should focus on. For example, if the number pattern is 174, the user should consider the 1st letter in "Green" (G), the 7th letter in "Emerald" (D), and the 3rd letter in "Orange" (N).
5. By combining these letters, the user will arrive at the sequence "GDN."
6. Once the player identifies "GDN," they must scan the corresponding QR code.
