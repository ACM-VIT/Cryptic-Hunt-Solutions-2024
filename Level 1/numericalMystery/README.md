## Description of the Question

In the heart of a vibrant kingdom called Diversia, where fiery Blazers clashed with serene Tranquils, chaos reigned as arguments over the annual festival escalated into fierce brawls. Each side, convinced of their own superiority, filled the air with shouts and despair. But when a wise old woman shared the tale of two mountains—one jagged and bold, the other smooth and gentle—their hearts began to shift. Realizing that their differences were not flaws but essential parts of a beautiful whole, they merged their visions into an unforgettable celebration, where raucous laughter intertwined with soothing melodies, revealing that the true magic of Diversia lay in the harmony of its polar opposites.
