## Solution

1. The player is given a link to the website which consists of a simple jigsaw puzzle and a button.
2. The button reveals a message which says "What's a plus sign doing here? Is it a code? Is it a cipher? Maybe this is the map to the treasure you're looking for...".
3. This sentence is the hint to solving the question. The jigsaw puzzle once solved shows the code `7J4XX5C7+F8`.
4. This code is a plus code which is an alternate representation of a geographical location of an area.
5. The revealed plus code can be put into google maps to get the location of the QR code which is the Domino's near SJT.
6. The players can scan the QR code to get points.
