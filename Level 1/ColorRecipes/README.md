## Solution 

Since VK (Virat Kohli) whose number is 18 is 30 ie there is a shift of 2 for each digit so to find the correct numbers they need to do a shift of 2 backwards and they will get 361,280,386,1585,361,173 which are pantone codes (the company that makes color recipes). the player will search the color codes and will find they are some shades of Green,Blue,Yellow,Orange,Green,Red looking at how they end (the last letter) they will get the solution NEWEND
