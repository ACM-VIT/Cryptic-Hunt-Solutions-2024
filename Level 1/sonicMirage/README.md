## Solution

1. The player will be provided with an audio file in mp3 format.
2. The player has to reverse the audio in the file using any audio reverser.
3. After reversing the audio, it will have the following lyrics "To the folks that I know, Tell them I won't be long, They'll be happy to know That as you saw me go I was screaming this song, We'll meet again" which will be a riddle.
4. On thinking deeply, the player can relate the above lyrics with a gate as gates are the points of transition through which people pass through to leave a place.
5. From the question riddle, the player get to know something about a place where sacrifice, truth and prosperity unite. This refers to the indian flag. So the player has to find a place which has an indian flag and is near a gate. The place is kalpana chawla ground.
6. The QR will be at kalpana chawla ground near the indian flag.
