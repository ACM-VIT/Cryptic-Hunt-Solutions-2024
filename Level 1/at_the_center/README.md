## Solution

The location of QR code is the place between the main gate and entrance to the main building.
This place is usually not crowded. Lets observe the image. Its a modified screenshot of google maps.
The 3 places form a triangle and the location of the QR is at the center.
The hints to the 3 places are a follows(These 3 places have decent crowd):
The first place is security office which is direct.
The second place is periyar library so the hint here is kudi arasu which is a book written by periyar.
The last place is FE-SEM Lab CMCT so a faculty who is based there is given as a hint.
Apart from this at the right side corner u can see 1010 M this translates to 10m which is what shows up at the bottom
of google maps when the screen shot was taken.
Also if see the 3 hints form a triangle.
(The hints could be made harder by giving a more cryptic hint in the image if needed)
