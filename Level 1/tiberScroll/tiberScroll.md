## Description of the Question

A Mysterious Roman Scroll

In ancient Rome, a scroll believed to be penned by Julius Caesar was discovered. Adorned with laurel wreaths and eagles, it promises great wisdom to those who decipher its message.

The inscription reads:

"Beware the Ides of Julius and Augustus, for the wisdom you seek lies hidden in the shadow of the eagle."

The letters shift and dance, echoing Latin but in an unfamiliar script. Caesar's ingenious methods come to mind, but this scroll is different. Subtle rhythms and patterns hold the key.
